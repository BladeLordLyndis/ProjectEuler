Project Euler



1.
have a hashmap m
for 3 and 5
  while each multiple x is not greater than 1000
    put x in m
sum all x in m

==========

2.
while fibonacci term t is less than 4 million
if t is even
  add t to sum 
compute the next fibonacci term t
return t

==========

3.
create an array a of up to size sqrt(n) since this is the largest possible factor
for x = 2 until sqrt(n)
  if x is not marked
    while x * m <= sqrt(n)
      mark index x * m in a as a composite number
for each x in a
  if x is not marked
    add x to sum

----------

instead of using an array, use a hash table
