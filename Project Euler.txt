Project Euler



1.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

have a hashmap m
for 3 and 5
  while each multiple x is not greater than 1000
    put x in m
sum all x in m



2.
while fibonacci term t is less than 4 million
if t is even
  add t to sum 
compute the next fibonacci term t
return t
